# 🚀 io-uring-lab

[![Build Status](https://github.com/aabolfazl/io-uring-lab/actions/workflows/cmake-linux-io-uring.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aabolfazl/io-uring-lab)

A curated, purpose-driven collection of examples demonstrating Linux's high-performance `io_uring` API — focused on building real-world, scalable asynchronous networking systems.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project emerged from the development experience of [Vortex](https://github.com/aabolfazl/Vortex) — a high-performance Layer 4 Load Balancer built entirely with `io_uring`. During Vortex’s development, the lack of well-structured documentation and practical references made mastering `io_uring` frustrating and time-consuming.

**io-uring-lab** is here to fix that.

The goal is to provide:
- Clear, beginner-to-advanced step-by-step examples
- Real-world usage patterns (not toy demos)
- A foundation for building async libraries (HTTP, WebSocket, proxies)
---

## 🧠 Why io_uring?

- True non-blocking I/O with minimal syscalls
- Event-driven architecture built into the kernel
- Unified API for file, socket, timeout, and polling
- Clean replacement for legacy `epoll`, `select`, and `poll`

## 📦 Use Case

This lab exists to **understand every relevant operation from the ground up**.
