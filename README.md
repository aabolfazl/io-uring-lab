# üöÄ io-uring lab

A comprehensive collection of examples demonstrating Linux's high-performance io_uring API. This repository aims to be a practical learning resource for developers who want to understand and implement io_uring in their applications.

## üéØ Goal

The primary goal of this project is to provide clear, well-documented examples of io_uring's rich API features. Each example is designed to demonstrate a specific concept or use case, making it easier for learners to understand and implement io_uring in their projects.

This project emerged from the development experience of [Vortex](https://github.com/aabolfazl/Vortex) - a high-performance Layer 4 Load Balancer built with io_uring. During Vortex's development, I noticed that while io_uring offers powerful capabilities, the learning curve can be steep due to:
- Scattered documentation across kernel sources
- Complex interaction patterns
- Lack of comprehensive, beginner-friendly examples
- Limited practical implementation references

io_uring-lab aims to bridge this gap by providing the following:
- Step-by-step examples progressing from basic to advanced concepts
- Well-documented code with detailed explanations
- Practical, real-world usage patterns
- Clear path for developers to implement io_uring in their projects

Whether you're building a high-performance server like Vortex, implementing network tools, or just learning about modern Linux I/O, these examples will help you understand and effectively use io_uring's capabilities.
